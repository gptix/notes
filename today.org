test messages from backend to DS layer
- accept correct token
- deny missing token
- deny invalid token

test messages to DS layer to backend
- get proper token accepted
- get missing token denied
- get bad token denied

If a token is denied, 
- send a request to BE endpoint for new token
- get new token
- new token works

Andrew, please send link to code that we tightened earlier
- I'll retighten it

Choose a better test client- might as well use 'LambdaSchool'

Figure out how to store tokens on Heroku server
- nice to have functionality to be able to do this on Heroku and locally
what is the code to check the environment 
(e.g., 
if (os == Heroku):
  foo(baz tam)
else:
  bar(boggle deb0)


refactor PUT call to a separate fuction

Get 1000 tweets from Lambda School
store them so that Heroku can use them, and we can use them locally

get the Basilisk embedding (keep track of latest tweet included so that we can ask for new tweets)

store this locally and on Heroku


document how to use local environment variables in Jupyter notebooks
